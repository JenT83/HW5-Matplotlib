Based on my observations of the data, the following three things were noted:
1)	Urban is the largest city type for fares, rides, drivers;
2)	The percentage of urban drivers is larger than the percentage of fares and rides; and
3)	While rural is a smaller percentage of fares, rides, and drivers, it does have the largest cost for average fare ($).
